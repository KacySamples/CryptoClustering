### CryptoClustering
#Module19Challenge

## Summary
The assignment was to analyzing cryptocurrency market data.

Data Loading and Initial Exploration: I started by loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame and displaying initial statistics and plots.

Data Normalization: I used StandardScaler from scikit-learn to normalize the data.

K-Means Clustering: I performed K-Means clustering. This included finding the optimal number of clusters (k) using the Elbow method, fitting the K-Means model, and predicting clusters.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): I applied PCA to reduce the dataset to three principal components and analyzed the explained variance.

Clustering on PCA-Transformed Data: I repeated the K-Means clustering process on the PCA-transformed data and discussed the potential impacts of using reduced features for clustering.

Visualization and Analysis: I created various plots, including Elbow curves and scatter plots, to visualize and analyze the clustering results. I discussed how to interpret these plots and the implications of the observed results.

Comparative Analysis: I compared clustering results between the original and PCA-transformed datasets. This comparison included examining the clarity of clusters, computational efficiency, and interpretability.

Explained Variance: I calculated and discussed the significance of the total explained variance by the principal components in PCA.

Impact of PCA on Clustering: I discussed the impact of using fewer features (via PCA) on K-Means clustering, touching on aspects like cluster quality, interpretability, and the balance between overfitting and underfitting.
